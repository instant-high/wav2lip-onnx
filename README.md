# wav2lip-onnx (inference only)
This is my modified wav2lip version.
Inference is quite fast on CPU using the converted wav2lip onnx models and antelope face detection.

(Running on GPU possible but some code changes needed)

No additional modifications like face enhancement, face alignment.
Just same as the original repo: https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip

Modified face detection is taken from: https://github.com/neuralchen/SimSwap

For installation please read Setup.txt
