# wav2lip-onnx (inference only)
This is my modified wav2lip version.
Inference is quite fast on CPU using the converted wav2lip onnx models and antelope face detection.

(Running on GPU possible but some code changes needed)

No additional modifications like face enhancement, face alignment.
Just same functions as the original repo: https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip

(Modified)Face detection is taken from
https://github.com/neuralchen/SimSwap

For installation and inference please read Setup.txt

Converted models can be downloaded here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_l4QC2RJ9nXapSQRD61-Q4KbSApc53HM/view?usp=sharing
